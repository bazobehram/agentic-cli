# Welcome to agentic-cli documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and developing agentic-cli. This tool lets you interact with AI models through a command-line interface.

## Project Vision

**agentic-cli** aims to transform the original Google Gemini CLI from a cloud-dependent tool into a fully **local, open-source, multi-agent development environment** that works entirely on your own machine without sending data to external services.

### üéØ Core Goals:

1. **üè† Local-First Architecture**: Replace Google Gemini API dependency with local LLM adapters (Ollama, etc.)
2. **ü§ñ Multi-Agent System**: Implement specialized agents (researcher, coder, critic) that can delegate tasks to each other
3. **üñ•Ô∏è Warp.dev-Style Experience**: Rich Terminal UI (TUI) for monitoring agent workflows and interactions
4. **üîß Comprehensive Toolset**: File operations, code execution, safe shell commands with user approval
5. **üîì Fully Open Source**: Extensible architecture where users can easily add custom models, tools, and agents

### ‚ú® Key Features (Planned):
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally, no data sent to external services
- **Agent Orchestration**: Multiple specialized AI agents working together
- **Visual Workflow**: Real-time TUI showing agent interactions and progress
- **Modular Design**: Easy to swap LLM backends, add new tools, or create custom agents
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built by and for developers who want control and transparency

## Overview

agentic-cli brings the capabilities of AI models to your terminal in an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. The system consists of a client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server (`packages/core`), which manages requests to AI models and provides various tools for tasks such as performing file system operations, running shells, and web fetching.
